# Description   
Given an array of distinct integers and a sum value. Find count of triplets with sum smaller than given sum value. Expected Time Complexity is O(n2).        
Example:     
Input: arr[] = {5,1,3,4,7}     
sum = 12     

Output: 4      
Explanation: Below are triplets with sum less than 4:       
(1,3,4),(1,3,5),(1,3,7) and (1,4,5)
